In this assignment you'll work on adding two numbers together.

You'll want to make sure that:

- [ ] The two parameters are numbers
- [ ] The answer is a number
- [ ] Negative numbers are supported
- [ ] Decimal numbers are supported
- [ ] Large numbers are supported

Each time you submit your code we'll run some automated tests. Once those tests pass you're ready to turn in your homework. To do that, click the "Ready for review" button.

To work on this assignment you can work directly on GitHub and push your changes ([here's how](https://classroom.github.com/docs)). You can also clone this repository and work on the code locally. To do so:

1. Clone the code to your computer and open the folder
2. Checkout the `assignment` branch: `git checkout assignment`
3. Commit normally and push to GitHub

When you push up your changes the tests automatically run. Don't worry if they don't pass the first time, they are there to help find problems! If you want to run the tests locally run the following:

```
npm install
```

Then:

```
npm test
```
